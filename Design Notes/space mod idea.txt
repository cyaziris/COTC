DYNASTIC NICKNAMES
	Every dynasty has an associated nickname, which is automatically granted to any member of that dynasty who:
	 - Becomes a ruler
	 - Is not Neo-Feudalist
	 - Is not Imperialist and independent
	Causing said ruler to be referred to by their full name, rather than their first name and an ordinal number.

NATIONS/REGIONS
	Terran Confederation
		The Terran Confederation has been the united government of humanity since its
		foundation nearly five hundred years ago. Nominally a federal democracy governed
		by an elected President and Parliament, over the course of the past three
		centuries it has slipped into corruption and gradual decline, and is now effectively
		ruled by corporate interests and wealthy power-brokers.
		
		At the time of the Confederation's founding, it had nine member states - the Terran
		Commonwealth, the Five Great Republics of Xingjie, Tierra Celeste, al-Samawat, Angani, and
		the Frontier, and the three lesser states of the Centauri Reach - the Republics of
		Gagarin and Tereshkovna and the Tengoku Protectorate. These states represented the
		full extent of human civilization, but after joining the Confederation, they embarked
		on a new wave of colonization that saw the settlement of a new Periphery surrounding
		the Core Worlds. The lack of representation for these worlds in Parliament would
		eventually led to disaffection and the 31st century Crisis of the Confederation.

		Terran Commonwealth
			The Commonwealth was formed by the former colonial powers of Earth in response
			to the Colonial Revolution, when it became clear that Earth was now surrounded
			on all sides by potentially hostile foreign governments. The original Homeworld
			Alliance, created purely as a defensive measure, would eventually grow into the
			Terran Commonwealth as a Terran national identity began to emerge. It is from this
			that the dream of the Confederation, a unified human government, would finally grow,
			and be brought to fruition in the mid 2500s.

			Local Governments: Appointed Administrations
			
		Xingjie
			Of all the Great Republics, only Xingjie was colonized by a single nation, the
			People's Republic of China, and it inherited its parent culture's respect for
			meritocracy and bureaucracy. Xingjie is officially governed by an elected president,
			but the president's primary purpose is simply to maintain the elaborate civil service
			that actually runs the republic.

		Tierra Celeste
			The Celestean region was colonized under the authority of the Monte Roraima
			Organization, an international space colonization iniative comprising several
			South American countries with a shared interest in the Monte Roraima Space
			Elevator. As a result, while Spanish is the most common language, it is one of
			the most culturally diverse regions of the Core Worlds. The region is highly
			religious, with the majority of its population being Pilgrims, with the notable
			exception of Sector Sexto Sol, originally settled by Mexica, which is a major
			player in the Adoptionist movement. This puts the sector in direct conflict
			with the rest of Tierra Celeste.
			
			Cultures: Latin America, Mesoamerica
			Ideologies: Terran Federalist, Pilgrim, Adoptionist
			Capital System: Encrucijiada
			Fleet: Celestean Armada
			Full Name: Republic of Tierra Celeste
			Colors: Gold, black
			Leader: President
			Government: Democratic Elective Republic
			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Republics, Federal Elective Theocracy, Corporate Fiefdom
			
		al-Samawat
			al-Samawat is a nation of paradoxes. Settled under the authority of the Space
			Exploration Treaty of Cairo, its initial settlers consisted of Middle Eastern and
			North African countries, and many of them brought with them strong religious
			influences. Indeed, the Pilgrimage is at its strongest within al-Samawat, where
			most able-bodied adults are expected to journey to Earth at least once in their
			lives. In addition to this, however, al-Samawat is a center of technological
			innovation and became a flashpoint for the transhumanist movement, leading to a
			nation in which Pilgrims and Transhumanists mingle and frequently come into
			conflict.

			Government: Democratic Elective Republic
			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Administrations, Democratic Elective Theocracies, Corporate Fiefdom
			
		Zenye Nyota Angani
			The African Space Agency was long deemed a joke by most of the world. Officially run
			by the African Union but dominated by the continent's most powerful nations, the
			organization only managed to achieve success with the construction of the Lagos Space
			Elevator, the first home-built African space elevator and a serious rival to the
			European Union's tower in the central Sahara. This was what would ultimately lead to
			the birth of the poetically-named Zenye Nyota Angani (literally, "Star-Filled Sky")
			region. Like most of its neighbors, the Angani Republic is culturally diverse, with
			sectors representing a wide variety of African cultures, which in turn has led it to
			become one of the Confederation's most federal member states, as well as one of the
			ones most committed to democratic principles.
			
			Cultures: West Africa, East Africa
			Ideologies: Terran Federalist
			Capital System: Angani Moto
			Fleet: Angani Armed Forces
			Full Name: Republic of Zenye Nyota Angani
			Colors: White, Black

			Government: Federal Elective Republic
			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Republics, Corporate Fiefdom
			
		Frontier
			The Frontier region was settled under the auspices of NASA, the North Atlantic Space
			Agency (not to be confused with the National Air and Space Administration, one of its
			precursor organizations) and consisted primarily of colonists from the United States,
			Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with colonists from other western
			European states making up a small minority. The Republic of the Frontier deliberately
			modelled itself on the early United States, invoking the American Declaration of
			Independence during its secession from Earth, and as such is a federal republic. Like
			the Terran Commonwealth, however, the Frontier has fallen prey to wealthy business
			interests, in particular the Weyland Corporation.
			
			Cultures: United States, Commonwealth

			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Republics, Corporate Fiefdom
			
		Centauri Reach
			While much of the Centauri Reach was officially colonized by the Russian Federation,
			its topographic distance from Earth made it one of the most difficult colonial
			territories to police, and the regional government established at Gagarin was among
			the first to break away from Terran authority - before collapsing itself in the
			Centauri Civil War. Besides the two breakaway republics of Gagarin and Tereshkova,
			the Reach is also home to the Tengoku Protectorate, the first interstellar state to
			ever be settled without a direct Terran mandate, and home of Kojima Robotics.

	Helix
		Strugatsky
			Old dreams die hard, dreams of utopia harder still. Strugatsky was the result of
			Gagarin and Tereshkovan colonists who blamed Russia's fall from grace on its
			abandonment of socialism. To many on Earth, the idea of resurrecting the
			five-hundred-year-old Soviet Union was a laughable anachronism, but to the people of
			the Centauri Reach, the dream of Russian greatness was difficult to resist, and it
			brought with it a utopian ideology that was just as compelling. From this was born
			the People's Republic of Strugatsky, a colonial initiative that sought to reforge
			a new socialist order among the stars. Strugatsky is governed by an officially
			meritocratic bureaucracy, overseen by a Coordinator, and is remarkably internally
			stable. However, it faces severe external problems, as the Strugatsky Armed Forces
			are a relatively weak military and both of the state's neighbors, Novyy Edem and
			Jion, are militaristic and ideologically opposed to it.

			Leader: Coordinator
			Government: Federal Elective Administration

		Novyy Edem
			Within the Core Worlds, the Novyy Edem Hegemony is typically looked on as the epitome
			of the Vanity State, a colony born and forged from the vision of a single would-be
			messiah. Formed under the direction of Yuri Ivanovich Solomonov, Novyy Edem is a
			fascist dictatorship, governed by a Hegemon elected by the leaders of its seven
			Protectorates. The Protectorates themselves are nominally military commands, but in
			practice are family fiefdoms, which gives the Hegemony a somewhat feudal character.
			One Protectorate, Maoxian, recently broke away from the Hegemony to join the newly
			formed Republic of Xin Zizhiqu, something which has driven a wedge between the two
			nominal allies.

	Tianguo
		Xin Zizhiqu
			Xin Zizhiqu (literally, the New Autonomous Region) was a region of space opened up by
			the Xingjie government for free colonization shortly after the formation of the
			Confederation. As a result, the region is a hodgepodge of different governments, from
			democratic republics to Pilgrim theocracies to corporate charter colonies to the
			breakaway Protectorate of Maoxian, a region hotly contested by Novyy Edem. The
			newly-founded Republic of Xin Zizhiqu, created by President Zhen Zhao of the Republic
			of Xin Qin, is a disparate attempt to weld these many different states together into a
			coheisve whole, one strong enough to throw off the yoke of Confederate oppression and
			win its independence. Zhao faces the challenge of leading this ragtag collection of
			rebels and transforming them into a true nation.

			Government: Federal Elective Republic
			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Republics, Corporate Fiefdoms, Dynastic Elective Military State, Democratic Elective Theocracies
			
		Bianjing
			Unlike Xin Zizhiqu, Bianjing's settlement was a formal affair, conducted directly by
			the Xingjie government. As tensions in the Periphery began to rise, the Bianjing
			Central Authority declared martial law, putting most of its sectors under military
			rule. This would prove to be its undoing, as the Bianjing Militia had developed
			strong colonial sympathies. A military coup saw the overthrow of the civilian
			government and the establishment of a federal junta comprised of the commanders of
			the various military defense zones.

		Orion Reach
			While officially colonized under the direction of Tierra Celeste, the Orion Reach is one of
			the most diverse Periphery nations, with many disparate cultures intermingling. It was
			also the flashpoint for the Crisis of the Confederation, as Governor-General Juan
			Lebedev was the first colonial leader to demand independence from the Confederation.
			Now operating largely under military rule "for the duration of the emergency," and
			with its own corporate class growing in power, the Republic of Orion faces the
			challenge of defending its freedom from both the Confederation and its own rising
			elite.

	Veil
		Mukta Duniya
			Cobbbled-together nations are not a rarity on the Periphery, but Mukta Duniya takes
			it to an extreme. The region was not settled under any organized initiative, but by
			dozens of colonial movements, originating in both al-Samawat and Terran India. The
			newly-formed Republic of Mukta Duniya was created in response to the rising
			tensions of the Periphery, with a fundamental article of its constitution being that
			it would neither take up arms against the Confederation, nor assist it putting down a
			potential revolution. The Confederation took this association as an act of revolution
			in and of itself, and now the Mukta face a war they never wanted to fight.

		Tarka
			Once considered to be simply the largest state of Mukta Duniya, Tarka refused to
			join the Republic, instead taking up arms against the Confederation directly. It
			was founded by disillusioned Samawati transhumanists, and is the largest
			transhumanist state in the galaxy. The Tarkans are known throughout the galaxy for
			their use of cybernetics, and often distrusted as being not entirely human, but
			their military might is always respected.

	Witchhead
		Avalon
			An unusual Vanity State in the Periphery, the Military State of Avalon is known
			primarily for its unique use of advanced cloning technology. Avalon holds that
			the primary danger to good government is the mortality of good leaders, and thus
			attempts to hold onto those leaders through the use of human cloning. Its
			leadership is comprised entirely of cloned dynasties, with natural children of
			rulers being completely excluded from the succession. In recent decades, a distinct
			romantic streak has emerged among the clone aristocracy. It began innocently enough,
			with the formation of the chivalric Military Order of Avalon, but ran out of control
			in the Avalon Civil War of the late 2990s, when Grand Admiral Victoria XVIII Locksley
			was deposed and replaced with the so-called "King Arthur Pendragon," a boy who was
			allegedly a clone of the legendary King Arthur. Arthur's regent, prime minister, and
			primary backer, Joseph XVI Blackburn, newly-christened Duke of Galahad, now faces an
			uphill battle, fighting against the Confederate government, Locksley loyalists, and
			a people extremely skeptical of his messianiac claims.

		New Frontier
			The New Frontier, as the name implies, was settled by the Old, and it shares deep
			cultural connections with the Core Worlds. Indeed, were it not for the Wall of
			Demarcation that runs between the Douglas and Glenn sectors, it would be difficult
			to say where the Old Frontier ends and the New begins. That Wall, however, has driven
			a wedge between the two, as the New Frontiersmen accuse the old of exactly the kind
			of tyranny that drove them to rebel against Earth in the first place. Of all the
			Periphery States, the New Frontier most greatly resembles the Confederation against
			which it is rebelling, but its people still dream of destroying the corrupt hypocrisy
			of the Confederation, and letting the values on which it was founded rule once more.

			Local Governments: Democratic Elective Republics, Corporate Fiefdoms
			
		Jion
			Originally colonized by the Tengoku Protectorate, the worlds of the Jion region were
			kept on a tight leash. Authority was centralized on Tengoku, which remained the
			Protectorate's only voting member of Parliament. In the late 30th century, things
			finally came to a head. The Republic of Jion's founders cunningly declared their
			independence from Tengoku, but agreed to continue to recognize Confederate authority,
			leading the Confederation to deem them unworthy of its attention. While Tengoku
			reacted violently, the Protectorate Fleet was dealt a devastating blow by the
			newly-formed Jion Space Attack Force at the Battle of Akasei, effectively establishing
			Jion's sovereignty within the Confederation. This victory would come at a cost,
			however, as the Space Attack Force's commander, Admiral Ryusei Sato, was a radical
			separatist, who used his reputation as a war hero to back a military coup against the
			Republic's government. After seizing power, Sato declared the Military State of Jion's
			full independence from the Confederation.

MILITARY
Phases:
	Skirmish
		Mostly defined by dogfighting - warships are safe in this phase. This is where bombers should be picked off, before they can do damage in Melee.
		Fighters and Destroyers peak in usefulness here.
	Melee
		Big warships slam the hell out of each other. Bombers contribute. Fighters are useless and likely die like flies.
		Battlecruisers and Dreadnoughts peak in usefulness here.
	Pursuit
		Bombers and Troop Transports peak in usefulness here.

RELIGIONS / IDEOLOGIES
	General Overview
		"Religions" are re-purposed as "ideologies." From a purely religious standpoint, most of the galaxy would be atheists, agnostics, or lapsed Pilgrims, but the religion mechanics map well to ideological conflicts. The ideologies of the religion group model actual religions, but these indicate characters who hold their religions to be the MOST IMPORTANT values of life.
