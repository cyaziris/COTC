LAW STRUCTURE DESIGN GOALS
The ultimate goals for our demesne law/crown law/succession law conglomeration (henceforth "law structure") are as follows:

	- Allow for political maneuvering in a wide variety of different systems. Advancing the cause of your dynasty in a
		democratic republic should be very different from doing so in a neo-feudal empire. It also probably shouldn't be
		very good for said republic's democraticness.
	- Let the player "customize" their faction's government some extent, creating potentially bizarre societies.
	- Create a tug-of-war power struggle between central governments and their subdivisions. This is already present to a
		large degree in vanilla, but we can still expand on it.
	- Allow for true "powers behind the throne" - vassals who have more power over their liege than their liege has over
		them.
	- Finally, and most importantly, model the slow break down of law and order as a society collapses.
	
At the moment, the intermediate goals that best serve the above, in my opinion, are:

	- Find ways to let the player survive under succession laws like Catholic Bishopric or Appointment by rigging the
		system, using money and connections to put their relatives in positions of power.
	- Use a combination of factions, law voting, and possibly even the new College of Cardinals, depending on how it works
		out, to simulate national legislatures. The battle for power between these legislatures and the executive (that is,
		the actual holder of the title) should get at least SOME attention.
	- When the legislature is powerful, there should be fierce politicking for leadership of it. This is the intended purpose
		of the "Prime Minister" minor title. This leader should have considerable power, possibly more than the actual holder
		of the title in extreme cases.
	- Succession law changes should never be made by decree so long as there's a legislature to object to them.
	- Have at least one law that represents the national government's ability to enforce its power. This differes from crown
		authority in being a de facto measure, rather than a de jure one. If the national government can't enforce its laws,
		then Very Bad Things should happen - most notably, vassal infighting should be allowed. Restoring order should be a
		difficult process.
	- It should be theoretically possible for a government to have at least SOME control over its vassals' succession laws.
		Exactly how much should depend on both crown authority and the above "public order" measurement.
