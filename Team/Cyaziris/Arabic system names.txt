Arabic names translation notes
script notes: 
j, g = same letter, pronunciation varies
x, kh = same sound, strong h, compare Dutch ch or German ch in ich
H = h with dot under, strong throaty h
D,T,S,Z = emphatic consonants, written with dot underneath in transcription
' = glottal stop 
` = voiced glottalic (`ayn)
G = fricative glottalic (Gayn)

Pronounciation of various sounds can vary strongly across different dialects of Arabic

note: long vowels, either do or don't, but not both
note: do regions have specific Arabic origins, because the difference between j and g is dialectic
NOTE: I know you don't like the ones with the definite article, but Arabic has a tendency to make names of things definite. Personal names are automatically definite.
