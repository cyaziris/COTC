			field.

			Small pillbox-shaped computer replacing the right ear.

			An unobtrusive implant that looks almost like a tattoo, directly below the DNI's location.
		THOTH Implant
			Another tattoo-looking implant. This one goes over the right temple.
		Cybernetic Arm
			A robotic right shoulder.

Each graphical culture is a combination of one of six ethnicities and one of ten culture groups.

Ethnicity defines which genetically heritable sprites the graphical culture uses (e.g., faces, noses, etc.)
Culture Group defines which non-genetically heritable sprites the graphical culture uses (e.g., clothing)

Ethnicities
	European
	Hispanic
	East Asian
	Mesoamerican
	Middle Eastern
	African
	
Culture Groups
	Terran
	Xingjie
	Cielian
	Samawati
	Angani
	Frontiersman
	Centauri
	Avalonian
	Jionese
	Mukta
	
Each ethnicity will probably need its own genetic version of the mutations, should they be implemented

Each Culture Group should have its own set of clothing and headgear sets. Notes for future consistency:
