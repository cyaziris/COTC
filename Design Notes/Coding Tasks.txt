CODING TASKS
	BUILDINGS
		Custom buildings need to be defined. City, castle, and temple holdings
		will each need to have several new buildings defined. The basic concepts
		I want to hit are as follows:
			1.	Planetary traits, including Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, and
				Temperature. I'm currently working on this myself, so you can
				probably afford to ignore it.
			2.	A main colony building, that limits the maximum level other
				buildings on the planet can be raised to. For simplicity, these
				will be named xy_colony_n, where xy is the two-letter code for
				the holding type and n is the building size from 0 to 4.
			3.	Militia buildings. These should provide some levies, but only
				for smaller ships like fighters and bombers. POSSIBLY also troop
				transports.
			4.	Medical infrastructure. This should improve province disease
				resistance. There should also be some spinoff buildings that
				allow for interesting biotech options, like cloning or genetic
				modification.
			5.	Education infrastructure. This should improve tech growth. There
				should also be some spinoff buildings that allow for interesting
				cybernetics options, like getting specific cybernetic implants.
			6.	Assorted standard CK2 buildings that improve things like tax revenue
				and fort level.
	TECHNOLOGY
		Closely related to the above, technology needs to be overhauled to fit the
		new, space-age paradigm. I'm currently working on this as well. It may help
		you to know what the different techs have been redefined as, so that you can
		set your prereqs more logically:
			- TECH_LIGHT_INFANTRY is now Propulsion
			- TECH_HEAVY_INFANTRY is now Armor
			- TECH_CAVALRY is now Lasers
			- TECH_SIEGE_EQUIPMENT is now Missiles
			- TECH_NAVAL is now Warship Doctrine
			- TECH_RECRUITMENT is now Fighter Doctrine
			- TECH_CASTLE_CONSTRUCTION is now Civil Engineering
			- TECH_CITY_CONSTRUCTION is now Education
			- TECH_TEMPLE_CONSTRUCTION is now Interstellar Industrialism
			- TECH_TRADE_PRACTICES is now Interstellar Trade, but otherwise unchanged
			- TECH_FORTIFICATIONS_CONSTRUCTION is now Economic Policy
			- TECH_CONSTRUCTION is now Sociology
			- TECH_NOBLE_CUSTOMS is now Medicine
			- TECH_POPULAR_CUSTOMS is now Cybernetics
			- TECH_RELIGIOUS_CUSTOMS is now Biotechnology
			- TECH_MAJESTY is now Artificial Intelligence
			- TECH_CULTURE_FLEX is now Hyperspace Physics
			- TECH_LEGALISM is now Xenobiology
		You should continue to use the old tags for these techs, but understand that
		their flavor and workings has been radically altered.
	MILITARY
		Closely related with BOTH the above. The new military system needs adaptation
		in several areas:
			1.	New military units. At present, the current plan is as follows:
					LIGHT_INFANTRY are Fighters
						Skirmish: Good Attack, Weak Defense
						Melee: Weak Attack, Weak Defense
						Pursuit: Weak Attack, Good Defense
					HEAVY_INFANTRY are Bombers
						Skirmish: Weak Attack, Weak Defense
						Melee: Great Attack, Weak Defense
						Pursuit: Excellent Attack, Good Defense
					PIKEMEN are Combat Drones
						Weak in all phases, but have amazing morale.
					ARCHERS are Troop Transports
						Weak in all phases (except possibly pursuit).
						Used for sieges.
					LIGHT_CAVALRY are Destroyers
						Skirmish: Good Attack, Excellent Defense
						Melee: Weak Attack, Good Defense
						Pursuit: Weak Attack, Weak Defense
					KNIGHTS are Battlecruisers
						Skirmish: No Attack, Excellent Defense
						Melee: Good Attack, Good Defense
						Pursuit: Good Attack, Good Defense
					HORSE_ARCHERS are Dreadnoughts
						Skirmish: No Attack, Excellent Defense
						Melee: Great Attack, Great Defense
						Pursuit: No Attack, Good Defense
			2.	Understand the new logic behind the combat phases:
					THE SKIRMISH PHASE: Dogfights between fighters and screening by
										Destroyers.
					THE MELEE PHASE: 	Big slug-fights, mostly between capital ships.
					THE PURSUIT PHASE:	Loser tries to escape, winner tries to destroy
										or capture escaping ships.
			3.	New combat tactics. These should reflect the new units. New tactics for
				the different unit types should be unlocked by the corresponding Doctrine
				tech (Fighter Doctrine for fighters and bombers, Warship Doctrine for
				Destroyers, Battlecruisers, and Dreadnoughts, Artificial Intelligence for
				Combat Drones).
			4.	Siege tactics. Generally speaking, the standard Siege Tactics should be
				completely reliant on Troop Transports. More advanced Siege Tactics should
				be enable-able by decision, which allow other units to help, but at greater
				risk of destroying buildings in the holding.
			5.	Retinues. Ideally, retinues are going to be the main military force in
				CotC (Legacy of Rome will be required, alas). Try to work out the best mix
				of Retinue types and coax the AI into using them.
			7.	Campaign CBs. Military vassals should be able to use special Campaign CBs
				on anyone at war with their liege. Lieges should also be able to compel their
				Fleet and Navy vassals to declare Campaigns. Victory in a campaign should
				automatically mean a victory in the liege's war.
	PLOTS, AMBITIONS, AND FACTIONS
		These need a massive overhaul. Particular plots I'd like to see include coup d'tats
		and plots to replace specific cabinet members (I've already made something similar to
		the latter for AGOT). Factions should include political parties. Terran Federalists
		should probably stop declaring independence from Earth. It would be nice if it was
		possible for someone launching a coup against a vassal to convince the vassal's liege
		to look the other way, at the cost of a moral authority hit for said liege's ideology.
	IDEOLOGIES AND MORAL AUTHORITY
		This ties into absolutely EVERYTHING. The moral authority of your ideology is going
		to be a big deal - at the moment, it will just affect the popularity of that ideology's
		followers, but other effects could be thought of, I'm sure. Moral authority of an
		ideology should be affected by its actions, successes, and failures.
	VANILLA EVENT CONVERSION
		Vanilla events must be converted to use the new trait system. Some of them may be too
		medieval for CotC - these events should be identified and discarded.
