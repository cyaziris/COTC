# THE POWER OF THE TERRAFORMERS #
# A late-game megaplot
# Totally not a ripoff of a certain lost Doctor Who serial
# Gregory Hayes (Galle), with some help from cyaziris

# Basic Overview:
# An ancient alien race, like most ancient alien races, forgot to clean up
# some of their toys. Specifically, a fleet of autonomous terraforming ships.
# These ships are driven by an extremely powerful AI to reorganize the galaxy
# to better suit their creators, whose preferred environment is NOT the same
# as humanity's.
#
# In order to spread throughout human space, the terraformers masquerade as
# being helpful to humanity. First for peaceful purposes, later for military
# ones. Eventually, as they are given more resources and autonomy, they reveal
# their true goal: to wipe humanity from existence and make room for their long-
# dead creators.

# Potential Applications - the terraformers are used for terraforming
################
# These event are initially far more common than the 'glitches'
# The more widespread the terraformers are, the rarer they become
#
# terraformers.500	Province	Terraformers improve atmosphere on a random planet
# terraformers.501	Province	Terraformers improve hydrosphere on a random planet
# terraformers.502	Province	Terraformers improve temperature on a random planet
#
# These three events will actually tend toward the following planet combination, which
# was ideal for the terraformers' creators:
# Toxic Atmosphere
# No Water
# Burning Temperature
# They become more frequent relative to the 'correct' events the more powerful the
# terraformers are.
#
# terraformers.503	Province	Terraformers degrade atmosphere
# terraformers.504	Province	Terraformers degrade hydrosphere
# terraformers.505	Province	Terraformers degrade temperature
