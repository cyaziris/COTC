CRISIS OF THE CONFEDERATION TITLE HIERARCHY
TITLE TYPES
	Landed Titles
	Naval Titles
		Naval Titles represent formal military organizations. They come in both Kingdom (Navy) and Duchy (Fleet) tiers.
		They have the following special properties:
			- Always titular
			- No capital - they are created by decree
			- Tribal Type (they dissolve if the owner gains control of a landed title of equivalent rank)
			- Can be created at will by their de jure liege title
			- Navies that become truly independent immediately dissolve
			- Fleets that become truly independent become mercenaries
			- Can use the Military Campaign CB against anyone at war with their liege.
			- Succession law defaults to Appointment.
