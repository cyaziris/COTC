Just some basic information about each track:

1. Liftoff: To be extended in the future, to act as the introductory theme while the game is loading.
Finished 9/8/13.

2. Singularis: Slow strings and melody. Generic track, very spacious and can be used with any culture group or nation.
Finished 9/9/13.

Note to self: Glitched ending, fix when possible.

3. Eye of the Storm: Progressive quick strings and flowing horns. Also generic.
Finished 9/10/13.

4. Earth: Slow medodic track. Sounds nostalgic, once again generic.
Finished 9/13/13

5. Far from Home: Lazy filler track. Simply played piano with orchestral accompaniment.
Finished 9/15/13

Note to self: Could stand to be improved; Rather boring.

6. For the Confederation: Powerful anthem track. Relatively simple, but heavy hitting and epic. Intended to be heard by members of the Confederation itself.
Finished 9/22/13

7. Requiem for an Empire: Slow and sad melodic sound.
Finished 10/7/13

8. Pirate Fleet Approaching: Fast and dramatic with heavy horns and drums. Could potentially be specified to members of pirate factions.
Finished 10/7/13

9. Triuph: Big and epic.
Finished 12/11/13

Note: Hey guys, been a while. I'm going to try to write music a bit more frequently, so keep your eyes open. I was able to fix the processing glitch, so any tracks here will be
good for release. Cheers!

10. Hostile System: Low brass and slow, grows into a massive and adventurous chorus! My favorite so far.
