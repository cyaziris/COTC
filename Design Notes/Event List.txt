A major event overhaul is necessary to move CK2 into a more modern setting.

EVENT CHAINS BY CONTEXT
-Childhood-
	EARLY CHILDHOOD - (childhood personality traits list takes care of most of this. events will need to be localized for new time period.
		- Slow to learn to talk (Extraverted/Introverted? - Fb) (1900 38200)
		- Afraid of the dark  (1902 and 38202) god, the random percentages suck for the kid. whelp.
		- Getting into fights (%neurotic/%carefree/%brave vs %confident/%discplined/%craven ? - Fb add in random new traits, regardless.)(mod 1903 and 38203 for this?) EVTOPTD38203 will need to be adjusted.
	LATE CHILDHOOD
		- Child makes lots of friends (1935 and 38235)
		- Child doesn't make lots of friends (*1906 deals with a lonely child. goes to guardian 38206 where the guardian chooses between three options.)(50proud30shy20sloth/60greg40honest/60deciet40greg)
		- Child doesn't want to go to school (*1907 is similar to this, except is playing with friends vs studying. found in childhood events)
	ADOLESCENCE
		- Sexuality develops (gain or don't gain Homosexual)  (38234 and 1934 for early life. (1980 1985 for young men) (1986 for muslim removal) (1990 1995 for women) really 1980 paradox? yay inside jokes.
		- Teenager becomes infatuated 64010->64011 64012yay64013nay...continues to 64050 after 18 years old.

	- Married woman is pregnant (someone else's child) *event 402(OA)(t)
	- Unmarried woman is pregnant *event 401 (OA)(t)
	- Future child's parents have genetic modification done (*need some elaboration fb)
	- Pregnancy aborted - (* do I have religion and culture flags to reserve for in conditions? - fb)
	
	NATURAL BIRTH
	- Legitimate child is born
	- Secretly illegitimate child is born - (*event 318 and 319)
	- Openly illegitimate child is born (*event 300-312 should cover this with some describ modding)
	
	CLONING
	- Cloning initiated
		( I'm guessing we want to pull the same dna.and since the person may not married we'll need a container for the kid. - fb)
	- Clone decanted 
	
-Family-
	CHILDREN
		- Child wants a job or title (I'll try to figure out how to expand event 37000 under family chain. 37000 is primarily concerned with a landed title. And it can fire for any male family member. By Jobs, I assume you mean council positions? It also may be worth creating a static vaiable for the age of majority in each culture under the cultural modifier section, if you mean for them to be different. I can just do a function call to a variable - fb)
	SIBLINGS
	PARENTS
	OTHERS

-Romance-
	FALLING IN LOVE
	LOVERS' RELATIONSHIP
	AFFAIRS
	MARRIAGE
		- Two lovers get married
		-
	Polyamorous relationships - cyaziris wondered if this was posssible.
		- polyandry
		-polygamy
			- suspect five event triggered opinion modifiers to show love/love -> deep dislike between different partners?
			- as opposed to true spouses, we may be limited to a mutual consort status as such.
			- introduction of a new member in a relationship would likely require a event to intergrate a new member, with decision trees with random result modifiers for new spouse and old spouse(s).
			- I suspect it would be fairly easy to intergrate some of the lover feud events from lovers_events.txt given the rivalry and sick spouse event chains.
			- might be a neat idea, but obviously a lower priority. I'm curious if any events from the sword of islam deal with this dynamic - fb.
