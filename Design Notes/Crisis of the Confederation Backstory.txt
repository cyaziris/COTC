CRISIS OF THE CONFEDERATION BACKSTORY/FLUFF

TIMELINE
Early 3rd Millennium
	- First discovery of hyperspace
	- Foundation of several international space organizations, including:
		- The North Atlantic Space Agency
		- The Cairo Treaty Organization
		- The Monte Roraima Organization
		- The African Space Agency
	- Earliest colonies established close to Earth. Few of these colonies are
		on naturally habitable planets, most colonies are either domed or
		underground. Many planets have multiple international colonies
		established on them.
	- The Second Outer Space Treaty divides space into six sectors and assigns
		one to each of the six major colonial powers (NASA, CTO, MRO, ASA,
		Russia, and China). This eventually leads to them founding six colonial
		nations that are more integrated and monoethnic than those of the
		core colonies: The Frontier, al-Samawat, Tierra Celeste, Zenye Nyota Angani,
		Xingjie, and Gagarin.
	- Japanese multibillionaire Ryotaro Kojima founds the first "Vanity State,"
		the Tengoku Protectorate, in space just beyond Gagarin. The Protectorate
		is treated as a rogue state by Terran nations, and given no official
		diplomatic recognition.

2352-2367
	- The remote Republic of Gagarin declares its independence from Russia,
		beginning the Colonial Revolution.
	- The Tengoku Protectorate forms and alliance with Gagarin. Together,
		the two become the founding members of the Colonial League.
	- Russia's response to the rebellion is anemic due to Gagarin's topological
		distance from Earth. China and the NASA signatories regard the collapse
		of a rival as a good thing, although both become more concerned
		about the possibility of a rebellion in their own colonies.
	- The Colonial Revolution escalates. Terran governments initially see the
		independence movements as a chance to weaken their rivals, but things
		rapidly grow out of control. The Colonial League begins to back
		several independence movements. They are joined by native independence
		movements in the Frontier, Tierra Celeste, Angani, and al-Samawat, and
		coerce the Xingjie colonial government into declaring independence
		"in order to see to their own self-defense."
	- The Colonials deliver several devastating military defeats to the Terrans,
		using the combined power of the Colonial Fleet to smash the divided
		Terran militaries. Earth is eventually forced to concede all territory
		colonized under the Second Outer Space Treaty.
	- Now surrounded by hostile entities, the former colonial powers form the
		Homeworld Alliance, for the military defense of all remaining loyal
		worlds.
	- The Colonial League dissolves.
	
2385
	- The Homeworld Alliance signatories sign the Earth Defense Treaty,
		dissolving the Alliance and forming the United Commonwealth of Terran
		States.
		
2397
	- Sector Tereshkova secedes from the Republic of Gagarin, triggering the
		Centauri Civil War. Tereshkova is backed by both Xingjie and the Frontier,
		and is able to easily defeat the Gagarin government.

2402
	- The United Commonwealth Space Command is founded.
	
2423
	- Gagarin nationalists take control of the Gagarin government and
		immediately cut off all foreign trade through the Centauri Reach.

2425
	- Citing repeated attacks on Xingjie merchant vessels, Xingjie invades
		Gagarin, beginning the Hun Lao War.

2427
	- Gagarin IV is brought under Xingjie control, ending the Hun Lao War. A
		Xingjie-friendly puppet government is put in place in Gagarin.

2433
	- The Sixth Sons movement launches its first terrorist attack, demanding
		independence for the Sexto Sol sector from Tierra Celeste.

2437
	- Sixth Sons agents assassinate the Governor-General of Sexto Sol, declaring
		her to be a Celestean lackey. The Celestean government refuses to hold
		elections for her successor, instead placing the entire sector under
		martial law.

2439
	- The governor of Nantli declares herself President of the Republic of
		Nahui-Ahtle, and demands that the Celestean occupation end immediately.
		The entire Celestean Armada is immediately dispatched to Nantli to bring
		the colony back in line.
	- The Armada finds the planet defended by the Samawati Guard, who declare
		the newly-founded republic to be under Samawati protection. The Armada
		backs down, but diplomatic tensions between al-Samawat and Tierra Celeste flare.

2440
	- The Commonwealth offers to deploy peacekeepers to Sexto Sol. Both
		al-Samawat and Tierra Celeste refuse.
	- Samawati and Celestean forces engage in border skirmishes throughout the
		sector, but neither makes any serious attempt to drive the other out.

2441
	- The Jabra'ill Offensive sees the Celestean Armada launch an incursion into
		the Jabra'ill Sector, in an attempt to divert Samawati forces from
		Sexto Sol. Several planets are immediately put under Celestean occupation.
	- Samawat responds with a full-scale invasion of the Huehca System, merely a
		single jump away from Encrucijada.
	- International reactions tend to condemn either Tierra Celeste or Samawat based on
		national interests. Xingjie in particular begins massing forces in Sector
		Qinglong, which in turn prompts the Commonwealth to redeploy much of the
		UCSC to Altair.
2442
	- The Samawati Guard takes Huehca and launches an invasion of Encrucijada. The
		Celestean Armada is recalled to the homeworld, but their commanding officer
		refuses to retreat.
	- Encrucijada falls, and nearly the entirety of the Celestean civilian government
		is captured by Samawat. Those few who manage to escape flee wartorn Tierra Celeste
		for the safety of the Commonwealth.
	- Samawat demands that the Commonwealth hand all escaped Celestean officials into
		Samawati custody. The Commonwealth refuses.
2443
	- The Celestean Armada begins a desperate campaign through Samawati space, with the
		intention of claiming Makkat al-Jadiida.
	- The Commonwealth once again offers to broker a peace treaty between Tierra Celeste and
		al-Samawat. The Celestean Government-in-Exile consents, while al-Samawat refuses.
	- The Armada breaks through to Makkat al-Jadiida. A terrified Samawati government
		immediately rethinks their previous position.
	- Commonwealth peacekeepers are deployed en masse to the Makkat al-Jadiida and
		Sexto Sol sectors. Negotiations between al-Samawat, Tierra Celeste, and Nahui-Ahtle
		open on Earth.
2444
	- The First Treaty of Terra is signed, ending the Nantli War. Sexto Sol remains
		part of Tierra Celeste, but is granted vastly increased autonomy. Both al-Samawat and
		Tierra Celeste agree to non-aggression, with the terms of the treaty to be enforced
		by the Commonwealth.
	- Reactions to the Treaty in the Commonwealth are almost universally positive,
		but are mixed in Tierra Celeste and al-Samawat. Many are grateful for the end of the
		war, but others accuse the governments of capitulating to Earth.

2448
	- A renegade Celestean admiral launches an invasion of al-Samawat, beginning the
		Jabra'ill Crisis. He is eventually apprehended by a joint task force
		comprised of Celestean, Samawati, and Terran forces, and convicted of war
		crimes.
		
2465
	- The Commonwealth, Tierra Celeste, and al-Samawat sign the Second Treaty of Terra.
		Each joins the others in a collective military alliances and promises
		preferential trade agreements.
	- Anti-Treaty rebels begin to rise up in the Jabra'ill and Encrucijada Sectors.
		They are put down by their respective governments.

2472
	- The Angani Republic signs the Second Treaty of Terra.
	
2477
	- The Republic of Tereshkova invades Gagarin, with the full backing of the
		Frontier Space Command, allegedly with the intention of overthrowing the
		Xingjie puppet government.
	- Xingjie immediately sends forces to Gagarin's defense, beginning a massive
		and bloody conflict in the skies of the Centauri Reach.

2478
	- The Xingjie Space Force subjects Korolev III to massive orbital bombardment,
		killing millions. The Commonwealth and its allies demand that those
		reponsible be immediately tried for war crimes. Xingjie refuses.
	- The Second Treaty signatories immediately begin readying their military
		forces to intervene.

2479
	- The Commonwealth, Angani, Tierra Celeste, and al-Samawat begin a joint intervention
		in the Centauri War.

2480
	- The various hostiles of the Centauri War agree to begin negotiations on Earth.
	- The Third Treaty of Terra effectively ends the Centauri War, restoring an
		autonomous government to Gagarin, and enforces a non-aggression pact between
		the Frontier and Xingjie.
		
2489
	- The Terran Commonwealth, the Frontier, Angani, Tierra Celeste, al-Samawat, Xingjie,
		Gagarin, Tereshkova, and Tengoku jointly sign the Fourth Treaty of Terra,
		officially founding the Terran Confederation.

		to be a united republic, free of Tengoku rule, but still subordinate to the
		Confederation.
	- The Tengoku navy invades newly-founded Jion and demands a Confederate intervention.
	- President Maria Salazar refuses to intervene. She cites the rights of the people of
		Jion to self-determination under the Confederate constitution, but many in
		Parliament believe she is actually attempting to weaken rival megacorporation
		Kojima Robotics.
	- The Tengoku navy is defeated by the Jion Space Attack Force at the Battle of Akasei.
	- Ryotaro Kojima, CEO of Kojima Robotics and MP for Tengoku, calls for a vote of

		Shipping to her daughter Beatriz.
	- Beatriz Salazar defects to the Republican Party, along with several Celestean,
		Orion, and Jionese MPs, shifting the balance of power in Parliament.

		immediately lands his forces on Avalon IV and seizes the palace, though
		Locksley's five-year-old clone is smuggled to safety by loyalists.
	- Blackburn, as Prime Minister of Avalon, asks Earth not to interfere in internal
		Avalonian matters. Although Blackburn is unpopular on Earth, Weyland, not
		wanting to risk involvement, tentatively agrees, although he does dispatch the
		First Fleet to Heartland.
	- Confederate military forces are recalled from the Orion Reach, ostensibly to act
		as a reserve in case the situation in Avalon escalates. This is soon followed
		by an increase in pirate attacks on Lebedev Interplanetary.
	- In a surprising political move, several Celestean MPs defect to the Federalists,
